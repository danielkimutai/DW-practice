They operate hundreds of trucks of different types to collect and transport solid waste. The company would like to create a data warehouse so that it can create reports like:

 - Total waste collected per year per city
- Total waste collected per month per city
- Total waste collected per quarter per city
- Total waste collected per year per trucktype
- Total waste collected per trucktype per city
- Total waste collected per trucktype per station per city
